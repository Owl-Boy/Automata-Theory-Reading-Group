- Goal
	- This is supposed to be for noobs
	- introduction to a couple for flavours of automata
	- What I want then take away
		- Modification of the tool to build new tools is a common and elegant way to solve problems
			- modify properties (alternating automata etc)
			- adding more components usually makes it more powerful
		- Non-determinism is actually more powerful when systems aren't too weak or too powerful
	- Style
		- mostly want it to be kinda chill and informal
		- Do not want to explain with too many details (Tomato ptsd)
	- Finish in 1 hour? I think..... Yep 1 hour

	- [x] Modify Type
