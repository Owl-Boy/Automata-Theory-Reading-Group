- Intro
	- Hello, this talk is about the many flavours of automata
	- ppl that attended the prev talk have already seen 2 types. DFA and NFA
	- The main use of Finite Automata is to model systems, but as the name suggests the above models are only useful when we are working with finite models
	- We obv have stronger models, like Turing Machines (which is also an automata), so why worry about so many automata
		- very nice properties
		- we would like to have some of those so we make the system stronger in a way that lets us preserve some of these
		- Or we want one of the automata that we are currently working with nicer
		- Or you would just like to have some specific features for your purpose
- So here are some interesting flavours of Automata
	- Turing Machines
		- Even engineers know about this(well, at least the name)
		- Pretty OP (Church Turing Hypothesis says its the most OP)
		- Describe
		- All Programs in Imperative Languages are just Turing Machines
	- Push Down Automata and Context Free Grammars 
		- Describe
		- FSA < 1-PDA < many-PDA = TM
		- Parsing
		- PDA >= Context Free Grammars
		- Context Free Grammars >= PDA (maybe not explain)
		- 2 stacks TC o:
	- VASS and Counter Machines and Petri-nets
		- Describe
		-  FSA < PN = VASS < 1-CM < 1-PDA < many-CM = many-PDA = TM
		- Parallel Computation Modelling - multiple counters multiple registers
		- 2 counters TC o:
- Another way add to automata
	- Alternating Finite Automata
		- Describe
		- Making NFA Great Again - complementation
		- State complexity worst case $\Theta(2^{2^n})$ - Very concise descriptions possible
		- Conversion to DFA
	- 2-way
		- Describe - read only TM
		- Gautham gave a presentation on this!
- Making up new models for problems can actually be a really powerful/ interesting approach
	- Add a new features and/or restrictions
	- Mix and Match (one of the reasons why I did not give applications for a section)
	- Gautham and I tried a problem, so I made a random model, didn't use it, but it was cool
- Some more Fancy Flavours(remember mix and match is allowed)
	- Timed Automata
	- Probabilistic and Quantum Automata
	- Omega Automata
	- Tagged Automata
	- Register Automata
	- Weighed Automata
	- Unambiguous Finite Automata
